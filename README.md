## How to test

The goal of this project is to challenge the development of a feedreader application by writing test suits. The framework used in this project is Jasmine. At the bottom of the 'index.html' page, you can run all spec tests, defined in the 'jasmine/spec/feedreader.js'. The result '7 specs, 0 failures' indicates the application satisfies all the requirements in the spec.
